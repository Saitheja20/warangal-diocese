To foster & promote local vocations to the priesthood, Most Rev. Alponsus Beretta, PIME, the former Bishop of Warangal, laid the foundation stone for St. Pius X Seminary in 1954. Fr. Finelli, PIME, and Fr. Guido Tirinzoni, PIME, played key roles in stabilizing this Seminary, adding wings to the building and starting the Minor Seminary in 1961. Latin, English, Bible, Church History, etc. were taught. Several priests and PIME fathers contributed to teaching and spiritual formation.

                                                        Over the years, the system evolved with changes post-Vatican Council II. Intermediate studies were introduced in 1971. Since 1995, Fr. M. Yagaiah has served as the confessor and spiritual guide.

                                                        The seminary has helped form 95 local priests serving in Warangal, Nalgonda, and Khammam â€” including Bishop Thumma Bala.

There was a felt -need for yet another seminary to be established basically to impart priestly formation at Andhra Pradesh. Hence Bishop Thumma Bala, Bishop of Warangal, took the initiative to study the feasibility of starting a separate major seminary to accommodate the growing number of seminarians. As a result, by God's grace, the Diocese of Warangal established St. Xavier's Major Seminary at Karunapuram in the year 1999, adjacent to Vishwa Jyothi Don Bosco College of Philosophy. Within a year, construction work was completed and by June 2000, moved into the new seminary. It was blessed and inaugurated on 29th June, 2000 by Bishop Thumma Bala.

                                                        Twelve years down the line, we are happy that we could render committed and quality priestly and religious formation to the seminarians from different dioceses of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, and religious congregations namely the Fathers of the Precious Blood, The Salvatorians, the Fathers of Holy Cross and the Society of the Holy spirit.

                                                        the first two years. Later, it was realized that it is important to make provisions to meet the distinct formation needs of the Diocesan Students as well of the young Salesians.
                                                        Hence St.Xavierâ€™s Major Seminary was started to cater to the formation needs of the Diocesan Students. They go to Vishwa Jyothi for their study of Philosophy. In the meantime the Mill
                                                        Hill Missionaries have shifted their Formation House to Karunapuram and are sending their Students here. The Junior Sisters from different Congregations also have their Formation House
                                                        at karunapuram and send their Students to study along side the candidates to the Priesthood. The Salesians from Hyderabad, Dimapur and Guwahati Provinces have their Students here.

                                                        increasing number of seminarians from the Dioceses and religious congregations. There was a felt -need for yet
                                                        another seminary to be established basically to impart priestly formation at Andhra Pradesh. Hence Bishop Thumma Bala,
                                                        Bishop of Warangal, took the initiative to study the feasibility of starting a separate major seminary to accommodate
                                                        the growing number of seminarians. As a result, by God's grace, the Diocese of Warangal established St. Xavier's Major
                                                        Seminary at Karunapuram in the year 1999, adjacent to Vishwa Jyothi Don Bosco College of Philosophy. Within a year,
                                                        construction work was completed and by June 2000, moved into the new seminary. It was blessed and inaugurated on 29th June, 2000
                                                        by Bishop Thumma Bala.

                                                        Twelve years down the line, we are happy that we could render committed and quality priestly and religious formation to

There was a felt -need for yet another seminary to be established basically to impart priestly formation at Andhra Pradesh. Hence Bishop Thumma Bala, Bishop of Warangal, took the initiative to study the feasibility of starting a separate major seminary to accommodate the growing number of seminarians. As a result, by God's grace, the Diocese of Warangal established St. Xavier's Major Seminary at Karunapuram in the year 1999, adjacent to Vishwa Jyothi Don Bosco College of Philosophy. Within a year, construction work was completed and by June 2000, moved into the new seminary. It was blessed and inaugurated on 29th June, 2000 by Bishop Thumma Bala.

                                                        Twelve years down the line, we are happy that we could render committed and quality priestly and religious formation to the seminarians from different dioceses of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, and religious congregations namely the Fathers of the Precious Blood, The Salvatorians, the Fathers of Holy Cross and the Society of the Holy spirit.

                                                        the first two years. Later, it was realized that it is important to make provisions to meet the distinct formation needs of the Diocesan Students as well of the young Salesians.
                                                        Hence St.Xavierâ€™s Major Seminary was started to cater to the formation needs of the Diocesan Students. They go to Vishwa Jyothi for their study of Philosophy. In the meantime the Mill
                                                        Hill Missionaries have shifted their Formation House to Karunapuram and are sending their Students here. The Junior Sisters from different Congregations also have their Formation House
                                                        at karunapuram and send their Students to study along side the candidates to the Priesthood. The Salesians from Hyderabad, Dimapur and Guwahati Provinces have their Students here.
